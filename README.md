* Template - a Python project template

Project named: top level directory name (template here)

setup.py is the standard name for Python installation script, along with its
companion setup.cfg, which should contain the installation script
configuration. When run, setup.py installs your package using the Python
distribution utilities.

You can also provide valuable information to users in README.md, or
README.txt, or whatever. 

The docs directory should contain the package's documentation.

Packages often have to provide extra data, such as images, shell scripts, and
so forth. There's no universally accepted standard for where these files should
be stored. Just put them wherever makes the most sense for the project:
depending on their functions, for example, Web application templates could go
in a templates directory in your package root directory.
